# WearFace-Moon
Watch face that shows probably moon phase.
It's specifed to my Ticwatch E but should work on every Wear OS watch.
Moon phase is straight calculated and don't take into count such events like "Super Moon" or "Blood moon".
You can get this for free, or chage it if you want, but you can't sell it as yours.
